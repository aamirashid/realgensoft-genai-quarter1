# Python Print Function Practice Questions
# 1. Basic Printing:
# Write a Python script to print the phrase 'Hello, World!'.
print("'Hello, World!'.")
# Print your first name.
print('Amir')
# 2. Printing Multiple Items:
# Print your first name and last name in a single print statement.
print ("Amir Rashid")
# Print the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in a single print statement.
print(1, 2, 3)
# 3. Printing Special Characters:
# Print a string that includes a newline character to display text on two lines. For example:
# Hello
# World
print("Hello\nWorld")
# Print a string that includes a tab character. For example:
# Hello World
print("Hello\tWorld")
# 4. Using the sep Parameter:
# Print three different words separated by commas. For example: 'apple, banana, cherry'.
print ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', sep=', ')
# Print three different numbers separated by hyphens. For example: '1-2-3'.
print (1, 2, 3, sep='-')
# 5. Using the end Parameter:
# Print two words on the same line with a space in between. For example: 'Hello World'.
print('Hello','World', end=' ')
# Print the numbers 1 and 2 on the same line without a space in between. For example: '12'.
print('\n',1,2, sep='')
# 6. Escape Characters:
# Print a string that includes double quotes. For example: He said, "Hello!".
print('He said, "Hello".')
# Print a backslash character. For example: This is a backslash: \.
print("This is a backslash: \\.")
# 7. Combining Text and Numbers:
# Print your age alongside a descriptive message. For example: 'I am 20 years old'.
age = 59
print(f"'I am {age} years old'.")
# Print a number and a string together. For example: 'The number is 5'.
number = 5
print(f"'The number is {number}'.")
# 8. Basic loop Printing:
# Print the numbers 1 to 5, each on a new line using separate print statements.
print(1,2,3,4,5, sep='\n')
